    <h1>Welcome to our QR based Grievance Registration Project!</h1>
<p>
We are a team of passionate developers who believe in utilizing technology for the greater good of society. Our project aims to simplify the process of registering grievances by using QR codes. By using this innovative approach, we hope to make the process faster, more efficient, and more transparent.

Our team has worked tirelessly to develop a user-friendly system that can be easily accessed by everyone. We understand the importance of timely resolution of grievances and have designed our system to ensure that every complaint is addressed promptly.

Our project is built using the EJS framework, which allows for dynamic and responsive web pages. We have also integrated a robust backend system to ensure the smooth functioning of our project.

We believe that technology should be used to bridge the gap between citizens and their government. With our QR based Grievance Registration Project, we hope to make the process of registering complaints as simple as scanning a code.

Thank you for choosing our project for your grievance registration needs. We look forward to serving you and making a positive impact in your community.</p>
